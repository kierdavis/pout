README for Pout
---------------

Pout is a fork of the [GNOME Cheese][cheese] webcam app, with modifications to
make it more suitable to my home photo studio. Key changes are:

* Removal of the effect selector - the "Flip" effect is permanently enabled,
  making the app behave like a real-world mirror.
* Burst mode does not end once a particular number of photos have been taken,
  only when the user explicitly stops it.

Plans for the future:

* Support cropping and rotating captured photos.
* Support syncing captured photos to Google Photos.
* Rewrite it in Rust.
